# embeetles
my embeetle equivalent to Arduino sketchbook

These projects often expect that 980f/arduino is git cloned (or otherwise copied) into a folder 'shared' at the top level of this repo. 
If I only could accept some of the limitations of submodules I would make it a submodule, but I don't like how it freezes submodule checkout state.
See 980f/arduino's README for how this all works.
